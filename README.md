# Battleship Game

This project implements the classic Battleship game using test driven development and modern JavaScript.  The game logic lives in the `src/` directory and is accompanied by Jest tests that cover ship placement, hit detection, and win conditions.  I wrote the tests first and then built the functions to satisfy them, which really changed the way I think about writing code.  The interface uses HTML and CSS to render the boards and allow players to fire shots.  It's a fun way to practise TDD, DOM manipulation, and object oriented programming.
